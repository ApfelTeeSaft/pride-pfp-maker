<h1 align='center'>Pride PFP Maker</h1>
Customize your PFPs with pride flags!<br>

This is a very straightforward tool to easily customize images into pride pfps
<br>[Try it!](https://nectarboy.github.io/pride-pfp-maker/)

## A Short Note
This was supposed to be a project for june 2021,
but it was published like 2 months late ^-^;; who knows, it might get used this year

## How To Use
This tool was made to be very easy and fast to use;
simply upload any image, press some buttons, slide some sliders, and done!

You can customize things like pride flags, zoom, and others right away.
It even supports uploading custom images for any pride flags not included :D

### Features
```
- change pride flag design
- upload custom flag design

- slider for image zoom
- slider for flag ring size
- drag and reposition image
- toggle 2 modes: ring mode, and background mode (for transparent images!)

- export image as .PNG
```

### Todo List
```
- maybe add more flags
- refactor code and stuff :|
```

## Some Other Things
Sorry if theres a missing flag you want, i didnt want to add too many buttons to the page,
(also my tools rlly primitive and can only render flags with just horizontal lines eheh)

I hope the Custom Flag option makes up for it enough, though if you want to suggest adding a flag, tell me!
