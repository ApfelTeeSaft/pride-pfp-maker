>Customize your PFPs with pride flags !<br>
[Try it out !](https://nectarboy.github.io/pride-pfp-maker/)

## A Short Note
Some features are still incomplete (see todo list) !

This was supposed to be a project for pride month,
but i completed it like 2 months late ^-^;; who knows, it might get used next year

## How To Use
This tool was made to be very easy and fast to use;
simply upload any image, press some buttons, slide some sliders, and done !

You can customize things like pride flags, zoom, and others right away.
It even supports uploading custom images for any pride flags not included :D

### Features
```
- change pride flag design
- upload custom flag design

- slider for image zoom
- slider for flag ring size
- drag and reposition image

- export image as .PNG
```

### Todo List
```
- more flags (and flag types ?)
- add mode for transparent images with pride backgrounds

- refactor code and stuff
```

## Some Other Things
Sorry if theres a missing flag you want, i didnt want to add too many buttons to the page,
(also my tools rlly primitive and can only render flags with just horizontal lines ehe)

I hope the Custom Flag option makes up for it enough, though if you want to suggest adding a flag, tell me !
