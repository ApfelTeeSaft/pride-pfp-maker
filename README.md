>Customize your PFPs with pride flags !<br>
[Try it out !](https://nectarboy.github.io/pride-pfp-maker/)

## A Short Note
Some features are still incomplete (see todo list) !

This was supposed to be a project for pride month,
but i completed it like 2 months late ^-^;; who knows, it might get used next year

## How To Use
This tool was made to be very easy and fast to use;
simply upload any image, press some buttons, slide some sliders, and done !

You can customize things like pride flags, zoom, and others right away.
It even supports uploading custom images for any pride flags not included :D
